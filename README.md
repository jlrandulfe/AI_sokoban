# AI_sokoban

University project for making a LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT robot solve a Sokoban puzzle. There are 2 main differentiated parts in the project:

- The program for controlling the Robot: it is written in NXC, and it is responsible for reading sensor data and controlling the motors, so the robot can move through the maze by following the desired pattern.

- The puzzle solver: It is based on an A* algorithm. Given the input set-up of the map, it has to find the movements the robot needs to do in order to solve the puzzle.
