Deadline: 12:00 20/12.  
On Blackboard and a PDF by email to John.  
Max 10 pages, including figures.  
One report per group.

Describe briefly the design of your robot and solver
Reasons for decisions taken 
	- wheels or tracks in the robot
 	- what heuristic if any used in the solver
 	- etc.

Explain how you tested and evaluated your choices, 
Present the results of tests and evaluations, and draw some conclusions.  


Good idea: 5 pages for each of the robot and the solver (If it fits our work just remember the topics you need to cover)
	- 2 pages of design choices and reasons
		- Solver: heuristics and so forth

	- 2 pages of evaluation methods and results
		- Both: Use different maps
 			- determine time and space required for a given map (cite sources for different maps)
 			- how that scales with increasing complexity (solver)
 				- fx number of jewels
 		- Solver: Only describe how non-standard algorithms work
 			  Biggest map solved in reasonable time

 	- 1 page of discussion and conclusions


Exam: 	15.-19. January
	Individual oral 
	Questions in 
	 	- Entire project 
 		- Anything in the lectures (including the all material on BB)
 	Randomly choose a topic (die)
		- If robotic topic -> discuss the solver-related aspects of the project
 		- If search topic -> discuss the robot-related aspects of the project

If you specialised in the robot design for the practical work, 
you will thus be able to talk about that either in the topic discussion or in the project discussion; 
likewise if you specialised in the solver.  

Be aware that you need to be able to talk sensibly about both aspects of the course, 
though not necessarily to the same depth (unless you are wanting a 12 grade :-)).


If you have questions about course content or exam, email me and ask. 
If your allocated exam time clashes with another exam you have, 
tell me as soon as possible and arrange a swap with another group.  
I shall publish more information about the exam, 
such as the list of random-choice topics and typical questions you might be asked, 
before January.


Best wishes,

John
